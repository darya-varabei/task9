The Land Rover Range Rover (generally known simply as the Range Rover) is a 4x4 motor car produced by Land Rover, a marque and sub-brand of Jaguar Land Rover. The Range Rover line was launched in 1970 by British Leyland and is now in its fourth generation.

Additional models have been launched under the Range Rover name, including the Range Rover Sport, Range Rover Evoque, and Range Rover Velar.

The fourth generation Range Rover, codenamed L405, was exhibited in September 2012 at the 2012 Paris Motor Show.

It uses an all-aluminium monocoque unitary body structure, instead of the third generation's steel unibody â€” making it the first production 4x4 SUV to do so, resulting in a reduction of 420 kg (926 lb) compared to its predecessor.
